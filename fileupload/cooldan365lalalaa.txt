Dear Sir/Madam,

On the 11th July 2022, I had put my account on freeze, I was charged on the 12/July 2022 for a new month, and In your email, it says:
we may not be able to stop the direct debit.
Don't worry your next payment amount after the freeze will be adjusted, you won't pay for any time you didn't have access to the gym
However this is not the case, when I unfroze my membership on the 3rd September, I was charged on the 12/September 2022, for Â£20.99, this clearly contradicts the statement in the email (shown above), therefore I am requesting for the month that I had paid for on the 12/July 2022 and refund for the payment which was taken in the 12th September as Im still in the same month as I activated the membership
Thanks,
Daniel
